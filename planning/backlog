This is a collection of user stories.
## Must-haves
<!--- these user stories are necessary for basic usability. -->
- [ ] As a user I want to be able to see all the items in the list.
- [ ] As a user I want to be able to add a new item to the list.
- [ ] As a user I want to be able to remove any item from the list.
- [ ] As a user I want to be able to edit the description of each item in their list.
- [ ] As a user I want to be able to mark an item as "done" or "not done".
- [ ] As a user I want to be able to register myself, to log in and log out, so that I can keep the privacy of my list.


## Should-Haves
<!--- these user stories will complete the user experience, but are not necessary. -->
- [ ] As a user I want to be able to sort my list of items in alphabetical order.
- [ ] As a user I want to be able to add photo to the item of my list, so that I can better understand my list without reading.
- [ ] As a user I want to be able to share my list with another people, so that I can agree this one with my partner or children. 
- [ ] As a user I want to be able to split my items as important and not so important.

## Could Have
<!--- these user stories would be really cool ... if there's time  -->
- [ ] As I user I want to be able to hover the button `remove` and this button will change the color to `red`.
- [ ] As I user I want to be able to hover the button `add` and this button will change the color to `green`.
- [ ] As a user i want to be able to see the color `yellow` when I am entering an input to the `text box border`.
- [ ] As a user I want to see inside the `text box` the `light grey color saying` write here` to indicate me I can write something.
